ABSTRACT:
The prevalence of object-oriented programming in complex software systems presents difficulties in software testing owing to the emphasis on encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. To overcome these difficulties, researchers have proposed various sophisticated techniques and tools for testing object-oriented software. This review paper explores the literature in object-oriented software testing, detailing the multifarious approaches, their strengths, and limitations, and identifying salient research gaps. The findings of this review offer valuable insights into the improvement of the testing process for object-oriented software and will be of great utility to software developers and testers alike seeking to optimize the quality of their software systems.
